HX Reconfig brings B9 HX forward in gameplay balance according to its role: to provide immense cuboid parts for building interplanetary megaships. The problem here is that stat-wise, these parts have been left in the past and the default settings for its one heavy engine are very poor for making viable long-range ships.

B9 HX Reconfig performs/provides the following:
* Makes all parts less fragile on impact and more tolerant to aero heat (by very modest amounts).
* Makes the one fission reactor a weaker RTG but also compatible with Near Future Electrical and Wild Blue Industries: DSEV.
* Clones the RCS blocks to use LFO. 
* Clones the heavy engine. Now there are three of it:
  * The original engine is a proper hybrid plasma LFO and super plasma nuclear rocket.
  * One clone will use Karborundum or Explodium and behave as a nuclear saltwater rocket, providing unreal TWR and decent Isp at the cost of the entire ecosystem of any world it is used on.
  * One clone will use Liquid Hydrogen and serve as an Epstein-alike fusion drive with secondary afterburning mode.
* Integrates with WBI Play Mode switcher to change from using B9 Part Switch for resource switching and use Classic Stock equivalent of propellants.
* Provides unique and all-new plumes for each engine mode.
